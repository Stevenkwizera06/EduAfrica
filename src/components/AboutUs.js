              The Children’s Foundation provides specialized treatment,
              counselling and attentive care to children, youth, and families
              with complex challenges through a variety of programs and

              FASD, severe social, emotional, and developmental disorders and
              disabilities, and challenges that stem from a history of trauma,
              among many others.

          In the late 1940’s and early 1950’s a group of citizens lead by Esther
          Irwin had grown concerned about children who were not being successful
          at school and who often did not attend. They realized that without
          support and assistance, these children were not likely to have a
          successful outcome as they grew to adulthood. Over a period of ten
          years they met and planned how to address this issue. In 1957 they
          incorporated a charitable, non-profit society from the current
          location in Vancouver and began to help these children and their
          families. Since that time, The Children’s Foundation has helped
          thousands of vulnerable children and their families to better lives.
