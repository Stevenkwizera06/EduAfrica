            The Children’s Foundation is working to secure our future in Surrey.
            Help us make sure that we are there for children and families for
            years to come. Owning our facility out right will provide greater
            predictability and control over our occupancy costs and help us
            focus resources and energy on the services children, families, and
            community need.

          In the late 1940’s and early 1950’s a group of citizens lead by Esther
          Irwin had grown concerned about children who were not being successful
          at school and who often did not attend. They realized that without
          support and assistance, these children were not likely to have a
          successful outcome as they grew to adulthood. Over a period of ten
          years they met and planned how to address this issue. In 1957 they
          incorporated a charitable, non-profit society from the current
          location in Vancouver and began to help these children and their
          families. Since that time, The Children’s Foundation has helped
          thousands of vulnerable children and their families to better lives.
